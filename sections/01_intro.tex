\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

% One definition of form-finding
Tacos are a typical street food from Mexico.
Traditionally, there are three ingredients to tacos: tortillas, meat, and salsa \cite{lewis_computationalformfinding_2010, bletzinger_fiftyyears_2011}.

\subsection{Why do we care?}

We care about tacos because tacos are delicious.
We describe current approaches to make tacos in Section \ref{relatedwork}.

\subsection{Limitations of taco-making}
\label{limitations}

Current methods to make tacos face challenges and have limitations.

\subsubsection{Salsa is never right}
\label{salsa}

Taco lovers have to ask their neighbors if salsa is too spicy or not.
This is subjective and leads people to have their tongues hurt.
        
\subsubsection{Tortillas are cold}
\label{tortillas}

Taco makers forget to heat tortillas. Not crunchy, not good.

\subsection{Contributions}

We concretely describe our contributions.
\begin{enumerate}
    \itemsep 0em
    \item An automatic data-driven approach to calibrate salsa spiciness level.
    \item We add hot butter to the tortillas to keep them warm, oily, and delicious for longer.
  \end{enumerate}

\subsection{Outline}
\label{outline}

This paper is organized in five sections: we survey the literature and compare our approach to existing taco-making methods in Section \ref{relatedwork}, we present our novel taco preparation approach in Section \ref{method}.
We carry out several experiments to numerically validate the proposed method in Section \ref{results}.
The paper concludes in Section \ref{conclusion} with a discussion of our experimental findings, the limitations of our approach and future research directions.
